## My process

### Built with
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript language
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to use Nextjs and React with Tailwind CSS for styling. I was able to create a responsive website with the help of Tailwind CSS. I also learned to use the grid system. I also learned more about certain React core concepts like State management and passing down the Props. I also learned to use TypeScript for type checking. I tried my best to use type-checking wherever needed. Also I tried to use AI whenever I was stuck and had errors.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning React and Next framework. I want to learn more about the core concepts of React and Next. I also want to learn TypeScript and use it in my future projects.
